# Python-Data-Visualization
Python Data Visualization

This is the final course in the specialization Introduction to Python Scripting by Rice University.
It builds upon the knowledge learned in Python Programming Essentials, Python Data Representations, and Python Data Analysis. 
We will learn how to install external packages for use within Python, acquire data from sources on the Web, and then we will clean, 
process, analyze, and visualize that data. This course will combine the skills learned throughout the specialization to enable students to 
write interesting, practical, and useful programs. By the end of the course, students will be comfortable installing Python packages, 
analyzing existing data, and generating visualizations of that data. This course will complete the education as a scripter, 
enabling students to locate, install, and use Python packages written by others. Students will be able to effectively utilize tools and 
packages that are widely available to amplify your effectiveness and write useful programs.

Instructors: computer science professors at Rice University Dr. Scott Rixner and Dr. Joe Warren.
