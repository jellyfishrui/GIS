Draw a county-level map of the USA in matplotlib

Our task is to locate a map that includes the boundaries of the counties of the USA. Based on some Google searching, 
this map from wikimedia.org is a suitable candidate. The original map is stored in SVG format (scalable vector graphics) in which 
each line in the map represented in terms of precise mathematical coordinates. The advantage of this vector representation is that the 
map can be drawn as a bit-mapped (pixel-based) image of any resolution without a loss of accuracy.

The matplotlib code will draw these PNG images since matplotlib does not support drawing of SVG images.
